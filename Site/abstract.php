  <p>The main goal of a company is to create value and make a profit. The growth of
    the Internet and social media requires a new way of managing public perception and so the
    reputation of a company. Indeed, the online reputation management helps drive public opinion
    about a business, its products and services.</p>
    <br/>
  <p>All social networks have APIs (Application Programming Interface) which give access to lots of data about users (consumers).</p>
  <p>Through our research, we would like to show how social network APIs can be used as a new management tool for businesses.
    To reach our goal we chose Twitter’s API. We wrote a Python program which uses Twitter’s API to access data on twitter.
    The program allows us to make requests, get wanted informations and analyze it in a fraction of a second. For instance,
    it is possible to show on a graph the evolution of likes or retweets on the profile of a company and so study its reputation.</p>
  <br/>
 <p>As expected, the analysis of the data we are able to recover on social networks can be a good indicator of the online
   reputation of a company. Indeed, we can see how the company is perceived by the others, but also study the behaviour
   of its clients and the consumers in general. It is also possible to get information about the new trends.
   A company can make an appropriate offer, be attractive and fully satisfy its clients.</p>
