  <p>The main goal of a company is to create value and make profit. The growth of
    the Internet and social media requires to manage public perception differently and therefore a new
    way to manage companies' reputation. Indeed, the online reputation management helps driving public opinion
    about a business, its products and services.</p>
    <br/>
  <p>All social networks have an API (Application Programming Interface) which gives access to lots of data about its users (consumers).</p>
  <p>Through our research, we would like to show how social network APIs can be used as a new management tool for businesses.
    To illustrate our idea we chose Twitter’s API. We wrote a Python program which uses Twitter’s API to access its users' datas on twitter.
    The program allows us to make various requests, get pieces of information and analyze it in a fraction of a second. For instance,
    we have the ability to show on a graph the evolution of likes or retweets on the profile of a company and therefore study its reputation.</p>
  <br/>
 <p>To analyse social medias' data can be a good indicator of a company's online reputation. It gives us the opportunity to see how 
   the company is perceived by others, but also study the behaviour
   of its clients and consumers in general. It is also possible to get information about the new trends.
   This way, a company can make an appropriate offer, be attractive and fully satisfy its clients.</p>
